        I am a writer, photographer, and chef turned web developer.
        My background in writing has helped me develop organizational
        and critical thinking skills, while my time as a chef has
        turned me into a hard worker. These attributes reflect my
        tenacity in my ability to code, and I am determined to solve
        problems of all kinds. I work well with back end programming
        languages and frameworks such as node/express and Ruby on Rails.
        Coupled with my knowledge of basic front end languages and
        React, I am working towards being a full stack developer; I
        want to do it all!
